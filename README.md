## UX:

# Design:
## Color Scheme:
The colour palette was created with the thought to provide as much contrast as possible.The body background is black to make a good contrast with the ligth red headers and logo to remind the users of horror movies, besides white color is used for the paragraph in the introduction section to provide better contrast and readibility
### Typography:
Nosifer was selected for the main heading or logo on each of the pages, accompanied by Creepster for headers and Kdam Thmor Pro for main paragraph. Which the two first reminds us the texts in horror movies.The contrast between colors is checked in  [HERE](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Future Features:
- An Experiences page
- A Movies page to show available movies
## Testing:
The media queries were very challenging. It took a lot of trial & error in the Chrome Dev tool to adjust everything accordingly so that it would not display horribly when the page was to be resized.
I faced problem figuring out the right rules for the form  responsivity issue specialy for less than 500px wide screens then I figured out to give the select element a float rigth and to put the form element inside a div.
I realised that my memory page was loading slowly due to images sizes so I changed thier format from jpg and png to webp and it solved the problem.
While running the html files through W3C validator, upon initial run, some sections failed. Because I used empty h1's to place some icons througout the page once I removed them I passed it.
I also got stuck with the div elements' contents overriding the footer and I tried so many approach but then realized that the solution was very easy and I add margins the problem was solved.
### Validator Testing:
- Html files pass through the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) with no issues found.
![html-validator](/assets/images/readme-images/html-validator.png)
- Html files pass through the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no issues found.
![Jigsaw validator message](assets/images/readme-images/css-validator.png)

## Credits:

### Content:
As my knowledge of implementation is limited at this point of my learning journey, I took inspiration for the design of the memory page, along with the display of the social links in the footer element from the 'love running'project
My mentor [Malia Havlicek](https://github.com/maliahavlicek) helped me understand flexbox which was very help full in building a responsive webpage.
### Media:
The home page image and the registration page's background are collages I made by  Adobe Creative Cloud Express using some Movie Posters I searched in Google.
All other images in the memory page is my own media and photography.
