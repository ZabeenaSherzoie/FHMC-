## UX:
### Site Purpose:
Friends' Horror Movie Cinema is a cinema built for those who love spendig time with their friends specialy watching horror movies and playing games all night.
### Site Goal:
The intent of the  website is to introduce our audience to such a cinema and to aid them in getting the most out of their time spending with their friends and giving them the oppurtunity to choose the location, snacks and even the light of the salon.

### Current User Goals:

### New User Goals:

# Design:
## Color Scheme:
The colour palette was created with the thought to provide as much contrast as possible.The body background is black to make a good contrast with the ligth red headers and logo to remind the users of horror movies, besides a shade of grey is used to cover the introduction section's background for better readibility.
### Typography:
Nosifer was selected for the main heading or logo on each of the pages, accompanied by Creepster for headers and Kdam Thmor Pro for main paragraph. Which the two first reminds us the texts in horror movies.The contrast between colors is checked in  [HERE](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

All the imagery on the site, excluding the registeration page background and the home page hero image is my own photography. For the The Hero image and registeration page background I took the images from google and made a collage out of them.
